# Update Notes 08-09-2023

This is the August 09th 2023 development update for locky.film

## 🚀 New Features 🚀

### Revised *Awards* section (/about page)

To provide space for the (hopefully indefinitely) growing number of awards to be displayed on the *About* page, a new layout based on tabs has been implemented.

Each tab represents a category of awards; clicking on it will bring up a list of all related awards underneath the tab bar. The list extends vertically towards the bottom edge of the *About* page’s background image and becomes scrollable should the list extend further.

Each list entry may either be a single award or refer to a type/group of awards, in which case it is displayed as a collapsible element, a click on which expands a list of all awards of the group.

Because of the very limited horizontal space on mobile devices, the mobile version displays each award category as a vertically extending, collapsible element.

### Fullscreen mode for image gallery (/photography page)

A fullscreen button has been added to the mobile photography gallery. When tapped, all navigational elements as well as the background are faded out to display just the photo across the entire width of the screen.

The button appears next to the menu button when entering the *Photography* page, showing an »enter« icon (expanding box). When tapped and the fullscreen mode is entered, the button slides to the right and displays an »exit« icon (contracting box).

## 🛠️ Fixes 🛠️

### Mobile *Photography* page layout

A bug has been fixed which caused the slidable photo gallery on the mobile *Photography* page to be aligned at the top of the screen i.o. the center.
