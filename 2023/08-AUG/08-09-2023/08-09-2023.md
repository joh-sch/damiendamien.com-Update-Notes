# Update Notes 08-09-2023

This is the August 09th 2023 development update for locky.film

## ðŸš€ New Features ðŸš€

### Revised *Awards* section (/about page)

To provide space for the (hopefully indefinitely) growing number of awards to be displayed on the *About* page, a new layout based on tabs has been implemented.

Each tab represents a category of awards; clicking on it will bring up a list of all related awards underneath the tab bar. The list extends vertically towards the bottom edge of the *About* pageâ€™s background image and becomes scrollable should the list extend further.

Each list entry may either be a single award or refer to a type/group of awards, in which case it is displayed as a collapsible element, a click on which expands a list of all awards of the group.
