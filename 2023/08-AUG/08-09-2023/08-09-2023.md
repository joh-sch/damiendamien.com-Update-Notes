# Update Notes 08-09-2023

This is the August 09th 2023 development update for locky.film

## üöÄ New Features üöÄ

### Revised *Awards* section (/about page)

To provide space for the (hopefully indefinitely) growing number of awards to be displayed on the *About* page, a new layout based on tabs has been implemented.

Each tab represents a category of awards; clicking on it will bring up a list of all related awards underneath the tab bar. The list extends vertically towards the bottom edge of the *About* page‚Äôs background image and becomes scrollable should the list extend further.

Each list entry may either be a single award or refer to a type/group of awards, in which case it is displayed as a collapsible element, a click on which expands a list of all awards of the group.

Because of the very limited horizontal space on mobile devices, the mobile version displays each award category as a vertically extending, collapsible element.

### Fullscreen mode for image gallery (/photography page)

A fullscreen button has been added to the mobile photography gallery. When tapped, all navigational elements as well as the background are faded out to display just the photo across the entire width of the screen.

The button appears next to the menu button when entering the *Photography* page, showing an ¬ªenter¬´ icon (expanding box). When tapped and the fullscreen mode is entered, the button slides to the right and displays an ¬ªexit¬´ icon (contracting box).

### Editable *Contact* page section

The backend functionality of the *Contact* page has been revised to make sections of information on this page fully editable.

I.o. a single, fixed section for contact information (captioned ¬ªUK¬´), the backend now allows the creation of an unlimited number of sections. Each section is build up from so called content blocks, of which the following are available:

- Heading (e.g. a section headline)
- Text (a simple block of text, capable of containing links)
- Contact list (a list of contact informations, each consisting of a title, name and email address)
